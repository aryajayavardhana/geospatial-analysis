# Project Title: Time-Based Geospatial Analysis of Night-Time Light Data and Citizen Movement Restriction During COVID-19 Period

### Overview:
This research project focuses on analyzing the correlation between night-time light intensity and citizen movement restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Leveraging data from Google Earth Engine, we employed the Python library GeoMap (geemap) to visualize and extract geospatial information. The extracted night-time light intensity data was then processed into a CSV format for further analysis.

### Key Steps:

1. Data Source: Utilized Google Earth Engine to access comprehensive night-time light data, providing a rich resource for understanding changes in urban brightness.
2 . Data Extraction: Employed geemap in Python to efficiently extract and process geospatial information from Google Earth Engine. This step included obtaining night-time light intensity data relevant to the study.
3. Data Transformation: Transformed the extracted data into a CSV format, allowing for streamlined analysis and integration with other tools.
4. Data Cleaning: Applied rigorous data cleaning techniques to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the information, enhancing the robustness of subsequent analyses.
5. Interactive Visualization: Implemented Altair in Python to create dynamic and interactive visualizations. This step facilitated a comprehensive exploration of the relationship between night-time light data and citizen movement restrictions during the specified COVID-19 period.
